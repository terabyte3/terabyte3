<p>i make random things on the net. you've probably never hear of me, but i started coding by making discord bots in python. around the middle of 2021, i realized that python was a garbage language (yeah, it is) and began learning go. i found it a little complex, but since my comprehension is a walking skill issue i gave up go to learn rust. as previously stated, my comprehension is a walking skill issue, so basically i now know more rust than go. <b>please help i don't even know anymore</b></p>
